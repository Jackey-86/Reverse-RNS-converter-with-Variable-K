# Reverse-RNS-converter-with-Variable-K
This project implements a Reverse RNS Converter with a variable K, allowing reconstruction of integers from their residues using moduli sets of flexible length. It leverages the Chinese Remainder Theorem for efficient reverse conversion in modular arithmetic systems.  Did you know modular arithmetic is the backbone of modern cryptography?
